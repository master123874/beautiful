Poor Old Gentleman

An old gentleman was walking slowly along a street one day when he saw a little
boy  who was trying to reach a doorbell  which was too high for him.   He was a
kind-hearted old man,  so he stopped and said,  "I will ring the bell for you,"
and then he pulled the bell so hard that it could be heard all over the house.

The little boy looked up at him and said,  "Now we will run away. Come on." And
before the old gentleman knew what was happening, the naughty boy had run round
the corner of the street,  leaving the man to explain to the angry owner of the
house why he had rung the bell.
